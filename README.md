## Notes 

- The app uses a local MySQL database to store user accounts and recipes. Make sure MySQL is installed and running.  
- The MySQL Connector JAR is included in the `lib` folder for JDBC connectivity.  
- PDF export works without external libraries, so you donâ€™t need to install additional JARs for PDF generation.  
- This project was developed using Java Swing, focusing on desktop GUI applications.  
- Make sure to configure your MySQL database credentials in `Database.java` before running the app.  
- All recipe, meal plan, and calendar data are persisted locally in the database.
